# Python Crash Course 

This is a few lessons on getting started quickly with python. The notes here are aimed to be given as a tutorial over a couple of hours, but hopefully they can stand on their own and be useful for independent learners. 

There are 3 sections here which may be useful: 
1. Lessons
  - Here are the notebook files which you can run interactively 
2. Slides
  - RevealJS versions of the lessons 
3. Documents
  - PDF versions of the lessons 
  
You can generate all of these files and folders by running the script in the root directory (if you want, but shouldn't need to)

```bash
./export_slides_pdf.sh
```

# Setup for running via google colab

In this session we will be using the Python programming language. To
avoid having to install anything, and for a quick start, we will be
using <https://colab.research.google.com/>. Colaboratory is a service
offered by Google that allows running Python (and some other languages)
code remotely. If you're interested in continuing with anything covered
in this session then [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) is a very
simple, user-friendly, method of installing Python onto your own
computer.

**Before this session**, please ensure that you can do the following:

1.  Go to <https://colab.research.google.com/> and sign-in (can use your
    own Google account or create a new one if needed).

2.  Go to file $\rightarrow$ new notebook.

3.  You'll now see an empty file, there will be a blank box. Into this
    box type \"print('hello world!')\".

4.  Press the run button and check that it properly prints out your
    message.
