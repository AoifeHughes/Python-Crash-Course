# Python Crash Course 

This is a few lessons on getting started quickly with python. The notes here are aimed to be given as a tutorial over a couple of hours, but hopefully they can stand on their own and be useful for independent learners. 

There are 3 sections here which may be useful: 
1. Lessons
  - Here are the notebook files which you can run interactively 
2. Slides
  - RevealJS versions of the lessons 
3. Documents
  - PDF versions of the lessons 
  
You can generate all of these files and folders by running the script in the root directory (if you want, but shouldn't need to)

```bash
./export_slides_pdf.sh
```
